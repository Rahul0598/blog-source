Behavior change refers to efforts put in place to change people's personal habits and attitudes, to prevent disease [[1]](#1). 

As a part of I507, I was tasked to use a health monitoring application and change a behavior. The idea was to understand what it takes to change a behavior so that we can design better applications for other people.

In the context of Health (the topic of our class), behavior refers to a person's beliefs and actions regarding their health and well-being. They are influenced by a person's environment. Positive behavior promotes health and prevents disease while the opposite is true for negative behaviors. 

I have chosen to monitor and change my sleeping habits. Since I started my master's education, I have rarely slept for longer than 6 hours a night on average. Through this blog post, I will attempt to document my experience using a sleep tracker application on my phone over the course 4 weeks and see if I make improvements to my sleep schedule. 

## Background and Theory

### About me

The following is a screenshot from the "Samsung Health" application which shows the average sleep statistics this year from the months of January through September. It is evident that I sleep very late in the night.

The months of January through May were stressful and hard as I had taken three core subjects (9 credits) which were all essential to satisfy my degree requirements. I also had the added pressure of landing a summer internship.

In the summer (May - August), I was working full-time on my internship and worked part-time as a research assistant on campus, which was again called for long working hours.

The fall semester I decided to continue my internship and the research assistant-ship part-time (35 hours a week combined) along with two 13-week courses. Which (*sigh*) made it harder for me to manage my time again. 

Hopefully I would be able to break this cycle, with the help of some analytics and science.

### Behavioral Model - SCT

Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) discusses how individuals acquire and maintain behavior based on internal and external social interactions [[2]](#2). SCT takes into account a person's past experiences to factor into whether behavioral change will occur.

There are six constricts developed as a part of SCT, I will connect each of those with my situation.[[2]](#2)

1. **Reciprocal Determinism** : This refers to the fact that behavioral change is dynamic and related to an individual's personality and the environment they are in. 
2. **Behavioral Capability** : This refers to a person's ability to perform a behavioral change through knowledge and skills. I have identified the behavior I need to change and the negative impact it has on my performance. I know what to do (sleep early) and how to do it (manage time through the day in a better way). 
3. **Observational Learning** : Looking at others and emulating their behavior or inculcating their positive habits. A close friend of mine prioritizes sleep and mental well-being over all else. I engaged with them to understand how they manage their time and schedule. We set up a few study sessions where I sat with them while they worked through the day to understand their style of working.
4. **Reinforcements** : Internal or external responses to a person's likelihood of continuing or discontinuing a behavior. I am hoping that the application would provide positive reinforcements to keep up the behavior change until it becomes a habit. The only way I would break the behavior would be if I am overwhelmed by the schedule. 
5. **Expectations** : Refers to the anticipated consequences of a person's behavior. My primary expectation is to sleep and wake up on time, to have a more energetic morning.
6. **Self-Efficiency** : This refers to the level of person's confidence in their ability to successfully perform a behavior. I'm not so confident at the moment (not gonna lie). We'll see how it goes.

## Choice of Monitoring Application

There are two main things I look for while downloading an application: 1) the number of downloads, and 2) the average rating. "Sleep as Android" seemed to be the best one out of the available applications. I did not go into the available features and the details regarding the application before deciding to download it. The fact that it was also tagged as an "Editor's choice" made the decision easier.

## Onboarding Experience

The first time you launch the application, you are greeted with a swipe-able screen showing and describing the features of the application. I have personally never swiped all the way to the end of such tutorials on any app. So, when I first downloaded the app too, I skipped after the first few slides. Perhaps the tutorial were a video, then I would've watched it instead of the slides.

Few of the screenshots describing the available features, other than the primary feature of tracking sleep.

1. Smart wake-up feature sounds interesting. The app, apparently tracks your sleep patterns and finds the right time to wake you up, which is outside the REM sleep duration.
2. I listen to some podcast before I fall asleep, and I am not really used to having music or ASMR playing in the background while sleeping. So, I would pass on the lullabies feature.
3. I wonder how much battery the sonar feature would consume through the night. 
4. I have not been told that I snore in my sleep, except for when I am exhausted, then I snore.

The app requires permissions to access physical activity, maybe that is to keep of track of movements during the sleep which would aid in its tracking ability.
Once the required permission is given, you are taken to the button which would ask you to set an alarm.

{{< image src="set-alarm-lots-of-icons.jpg" caption="Window to set an alarm with some unknown icons(`image`)" width="300">}}

1. The dial is easy to understand, set the hour and minute for when you would like to wake up.
2. The little numeric input area is a faster way to set the alarm time, 730 transforms to 07:30AM and 215 transforms to 21:05
3. The microphone button is another way to set the alarm, with your voice.
4. The third button asks for permission to access your location data to set the alarm to the time of sunrise (I don't think I'd ever need that feature!)
5. The last button sets the alarm to your target wake-up time.

{{< image src="home-screen.jpg" caption="Home screen of the app(`image`)" width="300">}}

The home screen of the app has the features to set an alarm, tutorial slides and statistics of the most recent sleep tracking activity and the averages.
