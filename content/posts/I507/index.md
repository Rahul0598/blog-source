Behavior change refers to efforts put in place to change people's personal habits and attitudes, to prevent disease [[1]](#1). 

As a part of I507, I was tasked to use a health monitoring application and change a behavior. The idea was to understand what it takes to change a behavior so that we can design better applications for other people.

In the context of Health (the topic of our class), behavior refers to a person's beliefs and actions regarding their health and well-being. They are influenced by a person's environment. Positive behavior promotes health and prevents disease while the opposite is true for negative behaviors. 

I have chosen to monitor and change my sleeping habits. Since I started my master's education, I have rarely slept for longer than 6 hours a night on average. Through this blog post, I will attempt to document my experience using a sleep tracker application on my phone over the course 4 weeks and see if I make improvements to my sleep schedule. 

## Background 

The following is a screenshot from the "Samsung Health" application which shows the average sleep statistics this year from the months of January through September. It is evident that I sleep very late in the night.

TODO : add graphs for sleep cycle so far.

TODO : connect it to one of the theories.

## Choice of Monitoring Application

There are two main things I look for while downloading an application: 1) the number of downloads, and 2) the average rating. "Sleep as Android" seemed to be the best one out of the available applications. I did not go into the available features and the details regarding the application before deciding to download it. The fact that it was also tagged as an "Editor's choice" made the decision easier.
