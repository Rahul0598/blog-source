I am developing an approach to urban heat resilience that bridges the gap between climate science, data-driven research, and community action. My work combines satellite imagery, urban morphology, in-situ and wearable sensor data, and machine learning to model and predict urban heat patterns. I integrate socio-economic, health, and meteorological data to understand the impacts of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. Through projects like Local Climate Zone classification and personal heat exposure studies, I aim to inform equitable and sustainable urban planning solutions.

## What am I up to right now?

- Research Assistant at the [healthy cities lab](https://healthycities.sice.indiana.edu)
- Research on localized climate zone classification using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
- Understanding the impact of extreme heat on hospital visits
- Predicting hyper-local air temperature using remote sensing.
