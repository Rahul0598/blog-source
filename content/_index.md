# Hi, I'm Rahul
And I'm an [Informatics](https://informatics.indiana.edu/index.html) PhD. student at Indiana University Bloomington majoring in Health Informatics.
I listen to podcasts and read a lot of sci-fi. I'm tracking all the [books]({{<ref "/readings">}}) I've read recently here, hopefully I'll also start writing about those books.
I also write posts about general tech stuff on my [blog]({{<ref "/posts">}}).

#### About this page
This site's design is based on [Brian Chen's](https://chenbrian.ca/) website. 
If you would like to also like to have a site that *isn't an absolute eyesore* and *doesn't load a 40-pound jQuery file*, check out the [hugo theme](https://github.com/ihasdapie/bettermotherfuckinghugowebsite/) behind this website. 
Also, it is [more eco-friendly](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/chenbrian-ca/)!
